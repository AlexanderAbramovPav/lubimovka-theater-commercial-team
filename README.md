# Commercial project "Landing for the Lyubimovka festival"

## About the project:
Lyubimovka Young Drama Festival is an independent non-profit collective project of Russian playwrights.
Every year Lyubimovka holds a reception and selection of new plays by beginners and recognized Russian-speaking authors to enable novice authors to find their voice and be heard.
> "We want our festival to be a lively crossroads of opinions and views, in the center of which are new plays that speak about today's realities and values that form the basis of the life of modern man and society."

## Technologies
